# SharpBot

A C# Discord Bot that does things. This is really just a way for me to learn
more about C#'s/.NET's development environment and more advanced topics
(NuGet/packages, Extensions, TAP Pattern, Dependency Injection, etc.)

## Current Plans

- Playing Music
- Mini-games
- Database reliant features (MongoDB or DynamoDB? Or Redis?)
